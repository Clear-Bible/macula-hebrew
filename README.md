## Syntax trees, morphology, and linguistic annotations for the Hebrew Bible

This repository contains linguistic datasets for Hebrew, including data from:

1. MACULA Hebrew Linguistic Datasets © 2022 by Clear Bible, Inc, released under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license.
2. The text of the Westminster Leningrad Codex, released into the public domain by the [Groves Center](http://www.grovescenter.org/), and available at [tanach.us](http://tanach.us).
3. Morphology from the [Open Scriptures Hebrew Bible](https://hb.openscriptures.org), available on [Github](https://github.com/openscriptures/morphhb/).
4. Syntax trees developed by Clear Bible, Inc. together with the Groves Center. (Note: Clear was formerly known as Global Bible Initiative from 2014-2020 and Asia Bible Society before that.)  Recently, the Groves Center graciously released [Westminster Hebrew Syntax without Morphology](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-hebrew/tree/main/sources/GrovesCenter) under a Creative Commons CC BY 4.0 license.
5. Word sense data from the United Bible Societies [MARBLE](https://semanticdictionary.org/) project.

During 2022, we intend to add further datasets, which are under development:

7. Synonyms: Which Hebrew words are related in meaning?
8. Semantic roles: Who does what to whom? (Agent, Verb, Patient …)
9. Participant referents: Who is “he,” “she,” or “it” in this sentence?
10. Semantic similarity: Which phrases and clauses have are semantically similar to texts found elsewhere?

This data has been combined into a single set of trees.  There are two variants of the these trees, found in the following directories:

1. `nodes` contains this data in a set of nested `Node` elements suitable for many NLP systems and other systems that use recursive algorithms.
2. `lowfat` contains the same data in a form more suitable for some kinds of query systems and some kinds of display.
