The Westminster Hebrew Morphology (WHM) data has been removed from these files. Specifically, four attributes from the files Stephen K. Salisbury of the Groves Center shared on Thu. 13 Jan. 2022 @ 15:10 EST were removed as requested: the Lemma, UnicodeLemma, MorphCode, and MichiganCode attributes. The MichiganCode in the element nodes remain in these files because they are the representation of the Westminster Leningrad Codex text.
