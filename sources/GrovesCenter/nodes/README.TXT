The Westminster Hebrew Morphology (WHM) data has been removed from these files. 
Specifically, four attributes from the files Stephen K. Salisbury of the Groves Center 
shared on Thu. 13 Jan. 2022 @ 15:10 EST were removed as requested: the Lemma, UnicodeLemma, 
MorphCode, and MichiganCode attributes. 

The MichiganCode in the element nodes remain in these files because they are 
the representation of the Westminster Leningrad Codex text.
