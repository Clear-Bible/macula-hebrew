Cherith Glosses for the Hebrew Old Testament are glosses that show the meaning of each word in the whole WLC (Westminster Leningingrad Codex) in its specific context. They are created to help people who do not know Hebrew to understand the text. The glosses are in both English and Chinese. They are compiled by consutling all the major translations in English and Chinese and selecting the most common term in each case. It is therefore a "majority gloss" where alternative meanings are not included.
