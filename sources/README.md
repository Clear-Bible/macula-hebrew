The subdirectories of this directory contain source texts as
modified for inclusion into MACULA.  

- All texts have had `n` attributes added to them to provide a consistent numbering system for morphemes and words across all resources in MACULA.
- OSHB has been broken into individual morphemes, and some morphology has been corrected, with pull requests issued.
- Groves Center trees are provided in their original form so that it is easy to see what we have added to them or use them directly.
