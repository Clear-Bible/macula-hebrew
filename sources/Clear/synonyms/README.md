## Strong Numbers

Currently all files in this repository have zero-padded strong numbers. E.g., 7 = 0007; 349b = 0349b.

macula-greek has _strong_ with non-zero-padded number, e.g., `strong="7"`

macula-hebrew has _greekstrong_ non-padded, e.g., `greekstrong="846"` and _strongnumberx_ padded, e.g., `strongnumberx="0430"`

Thus the Greek strong numbers in Proximity are not padded and the Hebrew/Aramaic are padded.

**TODO**:

In the future, if we standardize strongs, this file will need updated.
