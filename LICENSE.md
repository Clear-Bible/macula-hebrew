1. Syntax trees that combine the Westminster trees with OpenScriptures Hebrew Bible morphology, with a common set of identifiers.
2. Identifiers for orthographic words and morphs.
3. Greek equivalents drawn from the Septuagint
4. English and Mandarin glosses taken from Cherith's glosses.
5. Strong's numbers for both Hebrew and Greek equivalents
6. Semantic domains and word senses drawn from the Semantic Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew (see `@sdbh`, `@lexdomain`, `@coredomain`, `@contextualdomain`)
7. Semantic frames (see `@frame`).
8. Participant referents (see `@subjref`, `@participantref`)
9. Synonyms (see `./sources/Clear/synonyms`)
10. Word Senses (see `@SenseNumber`) that are distinct from the Semantic Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew word senses.
